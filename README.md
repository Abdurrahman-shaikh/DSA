# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through Data Structures and Algorithms, primarily following **Striver's A2Z DSA Course**. My goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA, enhance problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

Each problem's solution will be implemented in Java and organized by topic.
